Python Assignment 1 - Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains solutions for Module 2: Basic Python Concepts.
It includes two tasks demonstrating basic Python programming skills such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, and user interaction.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

Takes two numbers as input from the user.

Performs the following mathematical operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

Example Output:

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

Takes a user's first name and last name as input.

Concatenates them into a full name.

Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Example Output:

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, John Doe! Welcome to Python Programming!
